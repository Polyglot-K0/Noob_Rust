// fn main() defines a function in Rust
// It is always the first code that runs in every exe Rust program

// The first line declares a function named main that has NO parameters and returns
// if there were parameters, they would go inside of the parantheses ()
// The function body is wrapped in curly brackets
// Most lines in Rust end with a semicolon 

fn main() {
    println!("HelloWorld!"); // println! calls a Rust macro, if it called a function instead, it would not need the ! - NOTE: USING ! MEANS youre calling a macro instead of a normal function
}
